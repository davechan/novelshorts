<p>One day, a screenwriter, Nancy McCarthy, passed by a house in her neighbourhood in suburban Wisa
She saw a house whose front yard had a flowering dogwood with lots of colourful paper cranes hanging on the lower layers of the tree
she observed the house&#39;s front yard for a few months, and there seemed to be more and more paper cranes on the flowering dogwood
sometimes, she saw an old lady watering the plants in the front yard
Once she approached the old lady and asked about the tree when she was out in the front yard
it turned out a man lived there with three daughters, at 6, 8 and 10
that old lady, Mrs. Flores, was their housekeeper
Mrs. Flores said her employer, a Japanese man, father of the house, hanged the paper cranes there
he hang them up one at a time. Never more than one a day. The paper cranes had notes written on them. Notes written to his deceased wife
he said he hoped his wife, Miho, could be one of the birds visiting the trees. And she could read his notes
He made the paper himself. It&#39;s washi paper, which was waxed so that it&#39;s water-proof
Nancy felt intrigued and asked to meet the Japanese father. Haru was his name
He agreed to meet with her. Nancy came into the house for a coffee another Sunday morning
He was a big man with thick black hair, looked overweight
All his daughters were there that morning, quietly playing upstairs
his wife, Miho, passed away from a household accident more than a year ago
he had been writing notes to Miho whenever he had spare time
Haru and Miho met in university
Haru came from a rural village in Japan. He was raised by his grandparents.
He only went to live in Wisa from the senior years of high school after his uncle&#39;s family moved there from Japan
Miho was 3rd generation Japanese in Wisa, even her parents were born and raised in Wisa
She didn&#39;t have much relations in Japan
Miho got pregnant by end of first year of university. The child was Haru&#39;s. He married her once they found out her pregnancy.
Miho only visited Haru&#39;s family in Japan once after they&#39;re married.
She had always felt paranoid about long-haul flights, whilst her three pregnancies and baby caring had sufficiently justified her not to flying to Japan
Last winter, Haru proposed to take Miho and the girls to visit his senile grandparents. His grandfather was turning 80
Miho was at first reluctant to go since their youngest daughter (Ai, at 5) had just been diagnosed with asthma
She worried about Ai&#39;s asthma. Worried that the change in climate would trigger an asthma attack
But Haru persuaded Miho to go, since Ai seemed to cope pretty well with the new medical condition
they had a fight over it, but Miho agreed to Haru&#39;s plan in the end.
they stayed in Haru&#39;s grandparents&#39; traditional japanese house, in the upper floor, which had 2 small bedrooms and a bathroom
The older two girls slept in one room, and Haru and Miho and Ai slept in another
the two rooms were connected, and only separated by a sliding door in between
Haru and Miho kept the sliding door open, so the older girls wouldn&#39;t feel left out at night
the grandparents&#39; room was on ground floor. They didn&#39;t climb the staircase often due to their clumsiness.
Their vision was okay, but they can&#39;t hear well anymore.
Haru&#39;s family arrived no sooner than Haru went out to the hardware store to get materials. The bathroom on the groundfloor wasn&#39;t friendly for seniors
he worried about his grandparents getting bone fractures from falls
He installed railings and anti-slip mats in their washroom to prevent slipping
After spending a few days in the village, Miho told Haru she was glad they came visit the old couple and his old home town again
she could feel the significance of the trip
They had 80th birthday celebration dinner with the grandparents
Haru&#39;s family had a great time sightseeing  and skiing
the landscape there was stunning. Memorable for Miho and the girls.
Haru was suddenly called to go to Tokyo for three days for business. His company was based there.
Miho and the girls stayed with the grandparents
On the first night, the weather was chilly and dry. Ai had an insistent cough
Miho quickly closed the sliding door, so that the older girls wouldn&#39;t be woken up by Ai
the older girls were too tired from the activities in the day anyway
the grandparents weren&#39;t woken up by Ai&#39;s cough either. Their senile ears usually gave them undisturbed sleep until sun dawn
Miho rushed to the bathroom in the middle of the night to get a basin of hot water
she wanted to humidify the bedroom for Ai.
the sisters were sleeping soundly despite Ai&#39;s fierce cough
Miho got the first basin, then went back to bathroom to get a second
A loud thud.</p>
<hr>
<p>No one responded to it. Ai kept coughing… and her breathing became difficult…
the next morning, the grandmother climbed up the stairs to wake up the girls. The older ones were stirring after hearing grandmother
Ai was still sound asleep, probably because she didn&#39;t sleep well last night (she later told grandmother she kept coughing last night).
Miho wasn&#39;t in either bedroom
Grandmother went to the bathroom, and found Miho lying there. Heart not beating already.
she must have had slipped on the wet floor and hit the back of her head at the corner of the ceramic bathtub
What happened after Miho&#39;s death was a blur to Haru
Haru brought his daughters back to Wisa soon after
There were a lot of &quot;What if&#39;s&quot;in his head
What if he had listened to Miho and stayed in Wisa? What if he hadn&#39;t left them and went to Tokyo by himself?
What if he had resisted his selfish bodily urge and waited till they got married to become intimate with her? What if they didn&#39;t get married?
It only seemed to him that if not for him and his self-centredness, Miho wouldn&#39;t have died so young. She was only 27.
He thought he survived his loss alright. He thought he was strong. At least he didn&#39;t lose his sanity. He was still going to work as usual.
Just that he had no interest in associating with anyone at all. Sometimes not even wanting to speak with his daughters.
A friend encouraged him to see a therapist. He did, but not until a year after the incident
He started writing notes to her on washi paper he made. Then folded them into cranes and hanged them on the dogwood tree outside his house
His daughters did that, too. And he helped them hang the paper cranes
since that visit, Nancy and her husband, Alexander (a retired journalist) became friends with Haru. So did their children.
Especially Nancy and Haru. Haru found it easy and comforting talking to her.
Though Nancy and Alexander were only slightly younger than Haru&#39;s parents if they were still alive, their children were classmates in school
Nancy and Alexander moved to a new district when their children went to middle school
20 years had passed, Nancy never seemed to be retiring. Instead, she stopped screenwriting and started to write novels
She&#39;s kept in touch with Haru with catch-up calls once or twice a year.
He would ask about her latest work. And she would ask about his daughters and whether Haru had met anyone interesting himself
And she would also ask about his health, since he had a stroke 4 years ago.
He survived the stroke. He&#39;s a survivor.
Once Nancy asked Haru if he would mind her using his story in her book.
Haru didn&#39;t reject it upfront, and he only said it in a roundabout way, saying he didn&#39;t think his life story was special enough to be the subject of a book
Nancy didn&#39;t pursue any further, lest he would feel being exploited
she only said  she didn&#39;t want to write a sad story, she wanted to write about survival and hope.
Haru said, &quot;Just wait till it doesn&#39;t hurt as much anymore&quot;
Recently, Nancy came visit Haru when she came to Tokyo to travel with her friends. Alexander had passed away some years ago.
The two had met a few times since Nancy&#39;s family moved. But she couldn&#39;t recognize Haru when she met him again.
He&#39;s so lean.
They talked about old friends do. Haru had always found it easy to open up in front of her.
He told her about the bargain he once had with God, whom he just assumed was some higher being in heaven. He wasn&#39;t religious.
He was lonely and unhappy. He told God he can trade anything (except his daughters) for happiness
Then he got a stroke soon after. He lost mobility of his right leg.
After having the stroke, he committed to a hardcore fitness regime. He lost 80 lbs.
His health improved and he became more contented with life and what it offered.
He joined a charity program and got training to be a team leader
&quot;Have you met anyone interesting lately?&quot; Nancy had to ask every time they talked
He told her about Danielle
He saw her profile in the applicant list, and requested to place her in his team saying they knew each other
They didn&#39;t really know each other, but Haru remembered having met her before.
In a varsity swimming pool. And at a Ballet
&quot;Did you meet her in person?&quot;
Haru told her about the evening after the orientation party
and told her about the letter in which Danielle said she&#39;s coming to see him
Perhaps he hadn&#39;t been in love for too long, he seemed like a teenage boy talking about a girl he liked.
&quot;So she&#39;s coming to see you soon? Are you going to bring her to see your home village in Japan as well?&quot;
&quot;see your home village&quot; the words kept swaying in his head. Like a heavy pendulum swinging underneath an old tired clock.
He became quiet. His lips would have quivered if not for his effort to pinch them closed.
He thought about Miho. His persuading her to come to Japan. Their fight. And her submission at last. And his invitation to Danielle to visit his home in Japan.
He said simply, &quot;No, I&#39;m going to meet her in Cambodia instead.&quot;</p>
