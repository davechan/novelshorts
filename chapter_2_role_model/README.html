<p>Adam was starting to doze off. Though it was past midnight already, the air was stuffy and hot.
It would have had been almost impossible to fall asleep, while sitting on a cold bench made with stainless steel at a train platform, if not for how exhausted he was.
He felt his head tipping forward, then his neck suddenly twitched and he was jolted awake.</p>
<p>The train platform was teeming with people waiting for the next train. They must be catching the last trains home.
they all stood in queues which looked orderly. In fact, too orderly unlike anything Adam had seen
they&#39;re standing in queues two by two (one male and one female)
and the queues were organized according to age range. Toddlers and children were separated from their parents and they stood in the line for toddlers and children respectively
the grown-ups stood in lines which had individual sign posts stating 20s, 30s or 40s, etc.
Adam felt it was the most hilarious scene he had seen</p>
<p>There were queues for 60s, 70s, and 80s… and more lines beyond that
Before he moved further on, he saw someone familiar in the line for 60s
it could be an old neighbour when he lived in his parents&#39; house when he was a teenager</p>
<p>The train was approaching, that woman turned her face away before Adam could make out her name
It suddenly hit him that he should have got on the previous train, so that he could catch Danielle in time, before she leaves home
He got to confide to her that he was blackmailed by someone
but his ticket was only good for the previous train. &quot;Should I get on the new train anyway?&quot; but he knew that the train staff were very strict
The train had stopped at the station, people were getting onboard in an orderly fashion.</p>
<p>At that moment, the old neighbour turned to him, and said, with a wink, &quot;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll tell her&quot;
Adam saw her climbing the stairs to get on the train. He panicked.
&quot;Tell her WHAT?&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p>Adam met Hazel way back when he and Danielle went to the same high school. Once a school friend, Mark Hamilton brought him to Danielle&#39;s church, where her Dad was the pastor.
That wasn&#39;t the first time Adam went to a church. Despite Mark&#39;s follow-up effort, Adam was not converted.
That was the only time he met Hazel, before he got engaged with Danielle 17 years later.</p>
<p>Danielle brought him home to have dinner with her parents for engagement announcement.
Hazel and Greg were just as Adam had expected for a pastor and his wife.
They looked amiable, but when you talked with them, there was some sternness in the air, such that you would choose your words more carefully</p>
<p>Though she had wrinkles gathering on her neck and at the corners of her eyes, Adam could imagine Hazel must have had been a beauty when she was young.
Danielle got her beauty genes from her. (Blond hair, blue eyes, high cheekbones, full lips, defined face cut…)
Adam thought he could get along pretty well with Danielle&#39;s parents. He even thought he&#39;s pretty well-liked, or at least he felt respected.
But the truth was they just didn&#39;t meet often enough to have conflicts.
Greg n Hazel lived in the country, while Adam and Danielle started their new home in Wisa</p>
<p>Danielle had spared the truth from Adam.
That Hazel wasn&#39;t smitten with Adam.
&quot;He&#39;s too friendly with women&quot; Hazel told Danielle, having had seen him dancing with his female friends at Danielle and his wedding banquet
But she was a practical lady. She was more worried about Danielle not landing another man &quot;considering her history (a divorce)&quot;, she just had to approve him
Danielle was afraid to ask Adam how he felt about her parents. But Adam offered his opinion without asked, &quot;Greg is always quiet. You don&#39;t know what he&#39;s thinking. While Hazel, when I think about her, I only think of the tuna melts she made. It&#39;s GASTRONOMICAL, if you ask me.&quot;</p>
<p>The night before the wedding, Hazel gave a Bible to Danielle, with bookmarks and notes beside verses she wanted her to remember
Amongst them was, &quot;For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh&quot;
But Hazel&#39;s belief in the verse didn&#39;t prevent her from expecting Danielle to call her everyday, or calling Danielle to find out why she had not called yet that day
perhaps that&#39;s because in Hazel&#39;s mind, that bible verse had an overriding verse,
&quot;Honor your father and mother&quot; (which is the first commandment with a promise)... Which she cleverly refrained from bookmarking, since she thought it would make her gift too self-serving, and since she bet Danielle would remember the verse from its frequent recitations back in Sunday School anyway</p>
<p>Danielle and Adam seldom fought, they only had disagreements.
Adam knew she must have talked to Hazel about issues in her family and her marriage, since Hazel always sent him bible verses the day after Danielle and him came close to argument
There were even times that Hazel asked Adam to meet privately at cafes to talk over his issues. Rather than staging a confrontation, she was usually softer than Adam had anticipated. She also claimed she had already admonished her daughter, too
Hazel&#39;s initiative to talk with Adam made him feel that she really cared about her daughter. Though it was equally possible Hazel relished being the middle person. She relished the thought of holding the secret recipe for her daughter&#39;s marital success.</p>
<p>Hazel had been frank in expressing that she found Danielle&#39;s divorce (from her first marriage) a disgrace to the family. But what could she do about her, she only had Danielle left.
Danielle had an older brother, who had left the family. Adam had never heard Hazel mention about him. He was like a taboo topic.
After Greg died (he died soon after Danielle got re-married), Danielle went to Bayville Creek to see Hazel once a week, even if it had to be a brief visit when she was swamped with work and caring for her kids.
Sometimes, Hazel came out to Wisa instead and she would stay for a week or two with Danielle&#39;s family. She would tell the people from church that her daughter&#39;s family was always requesting for her help in this or that. That they were simply coming up with excuses to make her come to Wisa.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Adam was usually able to view Hazel&#39;s visit from a positive light. When she visited, it meant he got good food at home that week.
Once she showed up with only a couple of hours&#39; notice in advance. Danielle saw Adam frowning when he heard Hazel was on her way to their home, but Hazel won them over once they opened the door.
&quot;Surprise!&quot; she said in a singsong tone.
Hazel had brought along a delivery girl from the florist, carrying bunches of fresh flowers in two large carton boxes. Assorted fresh flowers to decorate their suite.
it only took Hazel and the delivery girl a quarter of an hour to set up all the flowers, and their suite looked lively
the flower arrangement had softened the hosts&#39; hearts. Adam couldn&#39;t have the mood to complain about Hazel&#39;s short notice anymore.</p>
<p>Hazel usually knew her role as a house guest, to be agreeable and delightful at all times
though her knowledge of her role usually waned from the 4th or 5th day of her visit, she&#39;d get so comfortable that she started to transcend herself to the role of a hostess
She&#39;d make delicious dishes that required complicated arrays of ingredients and tedious preparations, while she&#39;d also start to come up with countless suggestions for improvements in Adam and Danielle&#39;s family
Luckily, Danielle had grown so used to it, as such she didn&#39;t even notice she&#39;s receiving advice from her mother
It&#39;s also lucky that Adam had been spared the majority of her opinions, which were mostly offered to Danielle</p>
<p>Adam could tell Hazel really held Danielle dear to her heart and wanted her to have a good life
since Hazel observed fastidiously, and gave advices that covered anything related to Danielle: Ian and Leah (her kids), Adam (of course he never got to hear her comments), the food in her fridge, her perm, her make-up, her nails, her outfit,
and the lamps and the wall colours in Danielle and Adam&#39;s apartment</p>
<p>When Adam was around, Hazel would be more discreet and make a roundabout way to express her opinions.
E.g. that time she asked, &quot;Did you choose this wallpaper because you liked it?&quot; Which was her way of implying the wallpaper was not pretty.
Her question caught Adam by surprise, &quot;Of course we do, why else would we have stuck it on our wall?&quot;
Then Hazel was quick to appease him, saying, &quot;Yes. Greg would have liked the colour, too.&quot; Though deep down she never approved of her late husband&#39;s choice of colours, not that Greg cared for hers anyway.
Hazel&#39;s showering of advices on Danielle didn&#39;t alarm Adam, perhaps until that time they received an unexpected carpet delivery, and it turned out that Hazel had order a new carpet for them to replace their current one lying in the centre of their living room. Gift for Christmas, she said.</p>
<p>Like most thoughtful house guests, Hazel knew better than overstaying her welcome
she&#39;d usually announce her plan of departure after a week or two in Adam and Danielle&#39;s home
However, she&#39;s every intention to make sending her away as hard (more like &quot;heartless&quot; in her mind) as possible for Adam, and especially, for Danielle</p>
<p>During the last two days, she would spend more time in the kitchen to make even more decadent cuisine to tantalize the young and mature taste buds in Danielle&#39;s family
She would go around the suite to look for clothing that needed mending (like the buttons hanging loosely at Adam&#39;s shirt cuffs, the holes in Ian&#39;s socks)
She would spend more time cuddling Leah (her roommate in Wisa), telling her love stories from the bible, so that the child would lend her voice, shouting &quot;I want Granny to stay! FOREVER!&quot; when she saw Hazel packing, alone in her bedroom.
For the rest of the time left in Wisa, Hazel would refuse to go out. You would see her sullen look. She would sit in the couch looking blankly out the window, not saying a word, for an hour. She would speak about her loneliness with visible silence.
By the time she leaves, she usually succeeded in tickling Adam&#39;s conscience, making him feel a little queasy; and also in leaving Danielle feeling relieved, but obliged to persuade her to stay a bit longer next time.</p>
<hr>
<p>On a Friday morning, Hazel was invited to a wedding reception of a friend&#39;s son at a private country club
That wasn&#39;t a place she would normally hang out
But when she was looking for the ladies room, she detoured a bit and let her curiosity be the guide
she happened to pass by an outdoor bar next to the tennis court
there, she saw Adam having a drink, with an attractive lady. Their rackets were resting on an empty chair next to Adam.</p>
<p>Hazel called Danielle at work, and asked about Adam, saying she wanted to ask him about commcercial acting (asking for a friend&#39;s daughter who&#39;s interested)
Danielle said he should be at work</p>
<p>&quot;Were you at Lynndondale last Friday?&quot; Hazel asked Adam when she came to Wisa the next day
&quot;Yes, why?&quot;
&quot;I saw you at the country club… with a lady.&quot;
&quot;Oh - she&#39;s a friend. We play tennis together sometimes. There&#39;re usually a couple more friends, but they couldn’t leave work last Friday. It was a weekday afternoon anyhow.&quot;
Hazel thought perhaps he was good at disguising, she couldn&#39;t see any signs of his being anxious.
&quot;No, it was morning. Danielle thought you&#39;re at work,&quot; Hazel said.
&quot;Oh yeah?&quot; he said with a shrug, as if saying he didn&#39;t remember, or simply he didn&#39;t think it mattered.</p>
<p>Hazel took a moment to search his face for any traces of anxiety. Adam&#39;s aloofness disappointed her. She was expecting to see sweat dripping down his forehead. To shock him.
&quot;Anyway, don&#39;t worry, I trust you. I&#39;m not going to tell Danielle.&quot; said Hazel at a higher pitch, flashing a reassuring smile.
&quot;Up to you. It&#39;s nothing. I just forgot to tell her&quot; said Adam, his voice gaining more assertiveness
&quot;We wouldn&#39;t want to cause unnecessary doubts in her.&quot; Hazel added, with an understanding look on her face... &quot;We&quot; as if there was an implicit union between Adam and herself now.
&quot;Yeah, you&#39;re probably right,&quot; Adam said absent-mindedly, as if it was really not something that would worry him.</p>
<p>After a pause, Hazel redirected the conversation,
&quot;Bayville Creek is boring sometimes. I&#39;m loving Wisa more and more these days.&quot;
&quot;Oh, come visit, anytime. Just let Dani or I know. The kids love having you here, too.&quot;
Hazel looked satisfied, for she felt that a pact had newly been made, in favour of her.</p>
<hr>
<p>Adam could not switch off his thoughts about work these days.
There had been a lot of changes. A new CEO, named Morgan McKinsey, had come, whom he heard was an Iron Lady in the advertizing industry. Moreover, one of his major accounts, which made up 25% of his portfolio, was also being solicited by an agressive competitor. Adam heard they were negotiating a regional agreement.</p>
<p>What&#39;s happening at home didn&#39;t seem to occupy his mindshare.
It was just a few days ago when Hazel brought two suitcases to their suite. She announced she&#39;s staying with them longer this time.
&quot;Just a few months&quot; said Hazel, grinning diplomatically. After the conversation about the Friday morning encounter at Lynndondale, she apparently had the imaginary pact with him in her mind.
&quot;Yes, a few months.&quot; echoed Adam, dragging out his words, nodding.</p>
<p>Before they went to bed, Danielle kissed him on his cheek, and thanked him for letting Hazel stay. She&#39;s too lonely in Bayville Creek.
But she asked if he was feeling alright, since he looked poorly lately.
Adam said he was just stressed with work, and that he had trouble sleeping through the night
Of course, he didn&#39;t give her anymore details about his sleep problem. It’s too shameful.</p>
<p>In the past, he occasionally had sexual dreams, but they never bothered him much, some were rather exciting to begin with.
But recently, he&#39;s been scared to fall asleep since he kept making disturbingly bizarre dreams that lacked any human sensibility.
For example, he dreamt about giving a speech at an award ceremony, and not realizing he had been touching himself down there, in front of the audience, until he&#39;s finished speaking.
He also dreamt about engaging in lewd activities with clients (men and women), and Morgan McKinsey and other colleagues would stand there to watch and sneer.
What was most unsettling was his dreams about being caught doing it with Hazel in different places - his office, a busy café or restaurant.
After a few nights of those dreams, he couldn&#39;t fall asleep at all. The sight of his bed made him feel tense.</p>
<p>After a few sleepless nights, he tried to tire himself out one night
he stayed up doing work in his study after dinner with Danielle and the kids.
When it&#39;s 4 am, he got dressed and drove to the gym which opened at 5am
he kept running on the treadmill, with a mind to exhaust all his energy, fears and frustrations.
By 6am, he&#39;s run 12km.  The monitor read that his heart was beating fast, like a madman</p>
<p>He sat down to rest for a while. He thought of getting a shower, but he had a sauna instead.
After a few moments, the heart rate monitor in the room flipped on the red light outside the sauna room, and triggered the alarm at the gym service counter
He could feel his heart beating crazily. He stumbled out of the sauna room to catch his breath, which felt like his last
A gym staff, a young guy, rushed over to support him and to lie him down onto a reclining beach chair nearby
He remembered telling the guy he was fine, he just wanted to take a rest there</p>
<p>He dozed off in the cushioned beach chair
he remembered dreaming. He was blackmailed in the dream.</p>
<p>&quot;Sir? You okay?&quot;  that young guy interrupted his dream
he was jolted awake. His muscles were so tense that they ached.</p>
<p>he looked at the gym clock, it was only 7.30 am. His heart was still racing in an elevated level, but he wasn&#39;t feeling dizzy anymore.
&quot;Yes, I was just lacking sleep.&quot; said Adam, managed a sheepishly apologetic smile. &quot;I&#39;m going home to rest.&quot;
Young guy asked if he needed help, Adam reassured him he&#39;s alright.</p>
<hr>
<p>It didn&#39;t take long for Hazel to unpack her two fat suitcases. She was going to bring more of her belongings over from Bayville Creek. She decided to stay with them, not for a few months, but for an indefinite period of time
On Friday mornings,
Danielle was usually the first one to leave home for work
Though Hazel would still see Adam taking his tennis racket to work, and she would be able to smell his generous spray of cologne, she didn&#39;t question him or make any comment on him to Danielle.
All seemed to be well.
Adam did not had those shameful dreams anymore.
Danielle finally didn&#39;t have to worry about Hazel getting lonely and feeling uneasy about it.
Hazel was contented, too. After all, she was convinced that she knew better than Danielle about the marriage discipline (she had never been divorced, so she just had to know better). She felt qualified to decide a lot of things for her daughter, such as what about Adam that Danielle needed to know, and what not.
Now that the pact had been securely in place. She was here to stay.</p>
